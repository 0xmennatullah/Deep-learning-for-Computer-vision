## Lecture 15: Object Detection – Super Detailed Skeleton

---

### 1. **What Is Object Detection?**

- **Definition**: Identify **what objects are present** **and** their **locations** (bounding boxes) in an image.
    
- **Difference from Classification**:
    
    - Classification → "What's in the image?"
        
    - Detection → "Where are the objects and what are they?"
        
- **Analogy**: Classification is like identifying whether a room has guests. Detection is like pointing to each person and saying who they are—exactly where, exactly who.
    

---

### 2. **Before Deep Learning: Traditional Detectors**

- **Handcrafted feature + sliding window**: e.g., Viola–Jones (face detection), HOG + SVM.
    
    - **Pros**: Lightweight, interpretable.
        
    - **Cons**: Slow (evaluate many windows), brittle to variations.
        
- **Deformable Part Models (DPM)**: Detect objects by modeling parts and deformable configurations.
    
    - Better generalization but still limited.
        
- **Analogy**: It’s like searching for people in a crowd by looking through predefined masks—inflexible and expensive.
    

---

### 3. **Two-Stage Detectors (R-CNN Family)**

- **Workflow**:
    
    1. **Region Proposals**: Identify object-like regions (e.g. selective search).
        
    2. **Classification + BBox regression**: Run CNN on each region, classify and refine box.
        
- **Versions**:
    
    - **R-CNN**: Slow (per proposal CNN), accuracy good.
        
    - **Fast R-CNN**: Shared convolution layers via RoI Pooling—faster.
        
    - **Faster R-CNN**: Add Region Proposal Network (RPN)—end-to-end, efficient.
        
- **Analogy**: First shortlist possible people (proposals), then check each closely (classifier + refinements).
    

---

### 4. **Single-Stage Detectors: “You Only Look Once” (YOLO) & Others**

- **One-pass detection**: Predict boxes and class scores directly from full image grid.
    
    - **YOLO**: Divide image into grid, predict boxes per cell. Extremely fast (~45 FPS).
        
    - **SSD**, **RetinaNet**, etc.: One-shot detection with improvements like feature pyramids or focal loss.
        
- **Trade-offs**:
    
    - **Fast** but may struggle with small or densely packed objects.
        
    - **Smoother pipeline—no region proposals needed.**
        
- **Analogy**: Putting out a large net (grid) and identifying catches immediately—fast but coarse.
    

---

### 5. **Key Building Blocks Across Detectors**

- **Anchors**: Predefined boxes across scales/aspect ratios—used in Faster R-CNN, SSD, RetinaNet.
    
- **Bounding Box Regression**: Predict box offsets (Δx, Δy, Δw, Δh) relative to anchors or proposals.
    
- **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)**: Remove duplicate overlapping detections—keep the highest-scoring boxes.
    
- **IoU (Intersection over Union)**: Metric to measure overlap between predicted and ground truth boxes.
    

---

### 6. **Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) & Small Object Detection**

- **FPN**: Combines multi-scale feature maps—detect both large and small objects effectively without extra computation.
    
- **Context**: Small objects may lack pixel-level detail; FPN helps by incorporating higher-level contexts.
    
- **Analogy**: Like using both binoculars and a wide-angle lens—keeping detail and overall view.

### 7. **Summary Table: Two-Stage vs. One-Stage Detectors**

|Detector Type|Example|Main Advantage|Typical Use Case|
|---|---|---|---|
|Two-stage|Faster R-CNN|High accuracy|Quality-critical and variable scenes|
|One-stage|YOLO, SSD|Speed, simplicity|Real-time detection (e.g., live video cameras)|
|Hybrid (FPN etc.)|RetinaNet|Balance via multi-scale detection|Large-scale, diverse object sizes|

---

### 8. **Connections Across the Course**

- **CNN foundations (Lectures 7–8)**: Feature extractors, RoI pooling.
    
- **Optim and loss (Lectures 4–6)**: Multi-task losses—classification + regression.
    
- **Training strategies (Lecture 10–11)**: Anchor labeling strategies, data augmentation, handling class imbalances.

### 9. **Visual Analogies (for Your Brain Map)**

- **Sliding Window Detection** → Looking through magnifying glass spot by spot.
    
- **R-CNN workflow** → Filtering candidates through a metal detector, then conducting detailed pat-down.
    
- **YOLO/Grid prediction** → A smart grid overlay on a field that instantly lights up where objects are found.
    
- **NMS** → If many fingers point to the same location, stick with one pointing finger.
    

---

### 10. **Final Summary**

- Object detection = “What” + “Where.”
    
- Two-stage models = very accurate, slower, multi-step.
    
- Single-stage = fast, unified, sometimes trades off fine accuracy.
    
- Key mechanisms: Anchors, bbox regression, NMS, feature pyramids.
    
- This lecture sets the stage for pixel-level tasks (segmentation, next lecture).

Here’s the detailed skeleton for **Lecture 15: Object Detection (Michigan 2019 DL for CV)** based on the YouTube lecture and the broader object detection concepts. I’ll lay it out in a clear, visual-friendly structure with bullet points and analogies, even though direct transcript details weren’t fetched—this approach aligns with the style and depth you’re aiming for.

## Lecture 15: Object Detection — Structured Notes

### 1. Problem Setup: What Is Object Detection?

- **Definition**: Given one RGB image, the model must output a set of detected objects—each with a **bounding box (location)** and a **class label (what it is)**. ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MshSNnwF1Qg&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lecture 15: Object Detection (UMich EECS 498-007)"))
    
- **Contrast with classification**: Instead of classifying a whole image, detection requires localizing and identifying multiple objects within it.
    
- **Analogy**: Imagine you're in a crowded room (an image). Classification is like saying, “There is a cat in the room.” Detection is like pointing to each person and saying, “Cat near the door, dog by the couch, etc.”
    

---

### 2. Classic Object Detection Methods (Pre-Deep Learning)

- **Sliding-window + handcrafted features**:
    
    - Techniques like **HOG + SVM** or **Viola-Jones (Haar features + cascade classifiers)** scanned windows across images to detect objects. ([dvl.in.tum.de](https://dvl.in.tum.de/slides/cv3dst-ss22/2.ObjectDetection-Two-stage.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lecture 1 recap"), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Viola–Jones object detection framework"))
        
- **Limitations**:
    
    - **Slow**: too many windows to evaluate.
        
    - **Rigid features**: handcrafted, not learned.
        
- Serve as a **jumping-off point** to modern CNN-based detectors.

### 3. Two-Stage Detectors: R-CNN Family

- **Stage 1**: Generate **region proposals**—possible areas where objects might be.
    
- **Stage 2**: Classify each proposal + refine its bounding box.
    
- **OverFeat**: early CNN that slid over regions, then regressed bounding boxes. ([dvl.in.tum.de](https://dvl.in.tum.de/slides/cv3dst-ss22/2.ObjectDetection-Two-stage.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lecture 1 recap"))
    
- **R-CNN → Fast R-CNN → Faster R-CNN** progression:
    
    - **RoI Pooling**: extract fixed-size features from proposals to reduce computation. ([dvl.in.tum.de](https://dvl.in.tum.de/slides/cv3dst-ss22/2.ObjectDetection-Two-stage.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lecture 1 recap"))
        
    - **Faster R-CNN** replaces external proposal algorithm with a **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**—integrated and trained end-to-end. ([dvl.in.tum.de](https://dvl.in.tum.de/slides/cv3dst-ss22/2.ObjectDetection-Two-stage.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lecture 1 recap"))
        
- **Analogy**: Detecting objects is like buying tickets—first shortlist potential movies (proposals), then you go watch (classify+refine).
    

---

### 4. Single-Stage Detectors: Speed-First Approach

- **Goal**: Predict bounding boxes and class scores directly in one forward pass—no separate proposal stage.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: splits image into grid, directly regresses boxes and class probs. Super fast, but perhaps lower accuracy on small objects. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640?utm_source=chatgpt.com "You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection"), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Only_Look_Once?utm_source=chatgpt.com "You Only Look Once"))
        
    - **SSD**, **RetinaNet**, **FCOS**: other one-shot detectors addressing multiscale challenges. ([Computer Science](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~ronisen/teaching/spring_2023/web_materials/lecture_20_detection.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lecture 20: Object Detection"))
        
- **Analogy**: Sorting letters into bins—flap open mailbox (single shot) vs pulling each out individually (two-stage).
    

---

### 5. Key Trade-Offs: Accuracy vs. Speed

- **Two-stage detectors**: High accuracy, slower inference.
    
- **Single-stage detectors**: Faster, but may struggle with small objects or localization precision. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08707?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Optimizing the Trade-off between Single-Stage and Two-Stage Object Detectors using Image Difficulty Prediction"))
    
- **Real-world choice** depends on the application (e.g., real-time vs. high accuracy needs).

### 6. Crucial Techniques in Detection Pipelines

- **Anchors** (Faster R-CNN / SSD):
    
    - Predefined boxes of various scales and aspect ratios at each location.
        
    - Helps detect objects of different sizes. ([dvl.in.tum.de](https://dvl.in.tum.de/slides/cv3dst-ss22/2.ObjectDetection-Two-stage.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lecture 1 recap"))
        
- **Bounding Box Regression**:
    
    - Predict offsets (Δx, Δy, Δw, Δh) relative to anchors or proposals. ([dvl.in.tum.de](https://dvl.in.tum.de/slides/cv3dst-ss22/2.ObjectDetection-Two-stage.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lecture 1 recap"))
        
- **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)**:
    
    - Consolidate overlapping detections—keep the highest scoring box and discard others with high IoU. ([dvl.in.tum.de](https://dvl.in.tum.de/slides/cv3dst-ss22/2.ObjectDetection-Two-stage.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lecture 1 recap"))
        
    - Analogy: Crowded hands—only keep the one pointing to the same spot.
        
- **IoU (Intersection over Union)**:
    
    - Evaluation metric measuring overlap between predicted and ground-truth boxes. ([dvl.in.tum.de](https://dvl.in.tum.de/slides/cv3dst-ss22/2.ObjectDetection-Two-stage.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lecture 1 recap"))
        
- **Anchor Labeling** during training: anchors with IoU > 0.7 become positives; IoU < 0.3 are negatives. ([dvl.in.tum.de](https://dvl.in.tum.de/slides/cv3dst-ss22/2.ObjectDetection-Two-stage.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lecture 1 recap"))

### 8. Big Picture: Course-wide Connections

- Builds on CNN basics (Lectures 7–8): feature extraction, RoI pooling.
    
- Ties to optimization and loss (Lectures 4–6): regression loss for boxes, classification loss, multi-task.
    
- Bridges into Detection & Segmentation (Lecture 16), where these ideas are expanded to pixel-level prediction.
    

---

## TL;DR Summary

- **Object detection**: find “what” + “where” in images.
    
- **Two-stage vs single-stage**: trade-off between accuracy and speed.
    
- **Core tools**: anchors, box regression, NMS.
    
- **YOLO’s novelty**: predict in one pass, fast but less precise on small objects.
    
- Leverages everything you learned: CNNs, backprop, loss, and architecture design.
