# 1 -> 6 + 9,10 NN

## **Lecture 1 – Introduction & Computer Vision**

- **Concept**: Computer Vision = teaching machines to “see” images like humans.
    
- **Visualize**: Imagine a camera lens. The raw photo is a messy soup of pixels. Vision systems are like layers of glasses:
    
    - Old CV = hand-designed glasses (edges, corners, HOG, SIFT).
        
    - Deep Learning = automatic glasses that learn what to see from data.
        
- **Key takeaway**: shift from _rules_ → _data-driven learning_.
    

---

## **Lecture 2 – Image Classification**

- **Concept**: Given an image → predict which category (dog, cat, car).
    
- **Methods**:
    
    - **k-NN**: store all past examples, compare a new one to them.
        
    - **Cross-validation**: testing your model on unseen chunks of data to avoid fooling yourself.
        
- **Visualize**: Draw a scatterplot with blue dots = cats, red dots = dogs. A new dot (mystery animal) lands—k-NN looks at the closest friends around it to decide its label.
    
- **Difference vs Lec 1**: Lec 1 = _why CV is important_. Lec 2 = _first actual tool_ (k-NN).
    

---

## **Lecture 3 – Linear Classifiers**

- **Concept**: Replace “look at neighbors” with “draw a boundary.”
    
- **Methods**:
    
    - **Softmax**: assigns _probabilities_ to each class.
        
    - **SVM**: draws the **widest possible margin** between classes.
        
- **Visualize**: Imagine two clusters (cats vs dogs).
    
    - Softmax = a **soft blurry curtain** between them (probabilities fade smoothly).
        
    - SVM = a **hard glass wall** that pushes far from both sides (margin).
        
- **Difference vs Lec 2**: k-NN = “lazy memory.” Linear classifiers = “learn a rule (boundary).”
    

---

## **Lecture 4 – Regularization & Optimization**

- **Regularization**: keep weights small, discourage memorizing training data.
    
- **Visualize**: Like pruning a bonsai tree—cutting off wild branches (overfitting).
    
- **Optimization methods**:
    
    - **SGD**: drop a ball on a hilly surface (loss landscape). It bounces down step by step.
        
    - **Momentum**: same ball, but greased wheels → rolls smoother, doesn’t get stuck as easily.
        
    - **AdaGrad/Adam**: smart shoes that adjust step size depending on terrain steepness.
        
- **Difference vs Lec 3**: Lecture 3 defined _the model_. Lecture 4: _how to train it properly_.
    

---

## **Lecture 5 – Neural Networks**

- **Concept**: Stack many linear classifiers + nonlinearities = deep networks.
    
- **Key idea**: Each layer learns progressively abstract features.
    
- **Visualize**:
    
    - Input pixels → edges → shapes → object parts → whole objects.
        
    - Like a factory line: each station adds more structure.
        
- **Universal Approximation Theorem**: given enough layers/neurons, you can approximate _any_ function.
    
- **Difference vs Lec 4**: Lecture 4 = how to optimize a single model. Lecture 5 = make the model _deeper and more powerful_.
    

---

## **Lecture 6 – Backpropagation**

- **Concept**: Main algorithm for training deep networks.
    
- **How**:
    
    - Build a computational graph (inputs → operations → output).
        
    - Apply chain rule backward to compute gradients.
        
- **Visualize**:
    
    - Think of forward pass as **water flowing downhill** from source to ocean.
        
    - Backprop is **sending ripples back upstream** to adjust each rock (parameter) so the flow gets smoother next time.
        
- **Difference vs Lec 5**: Lec 5 gave us the structure (deep nets). Lec 6 gave us the engine to train them.
    

---
## **Lecture 9 – Training Neural Networks I**

- **Concepts**: Practical tricks to train well.
    
    - Data preprocessing: normalization, augmentation.
        
    - Weight initialization: Xavier/He init.
        
    - Non-linearities: ReLU vs Sigmoid/Tanh.
        
- **Visual**:
    
    - Think of data as food. Preprocessing = wash & cut.
        
    - Initialization = setting oven temperature right before baking.
        
    - ReLU = light switch (on/off cleanly). Sigmoid = dimmer switch (slows learning).
        

---

## **Lecture 10 – Training Neural Networks II**

- **Concepts**:
    
    - Batch normalization: stabilize activations.
        
    - Dropout: randomly “turn off” neurons → prevent co-adaptation.
        
    - Learning rate schedules.
        
- **Visual**:
    
    - BatchNorm = “thermostat” keeps room temperature stable → training smoother.
        
    - Dropout = students in class take turns answering → no single one memorizes everything.
        
    - LR schedule = start running fast, slow down near finish line.

### 🔹 **k-NN vs Softmax vs SVM**

```
k-NN:   [⚪ ⚪]        ?        [🔴 🔴]
         ↑ Looks at nearest dots
         Decision = "majority vote"

Softmax: continuous "heat map"
Cats probability = 0.7
Dogs probability = 0.3
Decision = smooth boundary (blurry curtain)

SVM: draws the "widest gap"
| Cats ⚪ |         | Dogs 🔴 |
         ← biggest margin →
Decision = crisp boundary (glass wall)
```

---

### 🔹 **Regularization**

```
No Regularization: 🌳 wild tree, branches everywhere (overfit)

With Regularization: 🌳 carefully trimmed bonsai
 → simpler model, avoids memorizing noise
```

---

### 🔹 **Optimization Methods**

```
SGD:       ⚽ ball steps down stairs (jerky)
Momentum:  🏀 ball with inertia (smoother downhill)
Adam:      🥾 adaptive hiking shoes (adjust step size per slope)
```

---

### 🔹 **Neural Nets (Layers)**

```
Pixels → [edges] → [shapes] → [object parts] → [whole object]

Imagine Lego bricks stacking into more complex structures.
```

---

### 🔹 **Forward vs Backprop**

```
Forward pass:   Input → Hidden → Output
                (like water flowing downstream)

Backprop:       Output error → Hidden → Input
                (ripples traveling back upstream)
```

# 7,8,11,12 CNN

## **Lecture 7 – Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) I**

- **Concept**: Convolution replaces fully-connected layers for images.
    
- **Why**: Exploit spatial structure → fewer parameters + translation invariance.
    
- **Visual**:
    
    - Imagine sliding a **small flashlight (filter)** across an image → highlights certain patterns (edges, textures).
        
- **Difference vs FC nets**: FC = every neuron connected → huge parameter explosion. CNN = local connections (like looking through small windows).
    

---

## **Lecture 8 – CNNs II**

- **Concepts**:
    
    - **Pooling**: downsample info (max/avg pooling).
        
    - **Deeper CNNs**: stacking conv layers → hierarchical feature maps.
        
- **Visual**:
    
    - Pooling = “squinting” your eyes: details go, big picture remains.
        
    - Layers = zooming in → pixels → edges → corners → eyes → face.
        
- **Difference vs Lec 7**: Lec 7 = basics of conv filters. Lec 8 = building deeper pipelines + compressing with pooling.
---

## **Lecture 11 – CNN Architectures**

- **Concepts**: Famous models (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet).
    
- **Visual**:
    
    - **LeNet** = baby CNN (2 conv layers).
        
    - **AlexNet** = teenager with GPU power (deep + ReLU + dropout).
        
    - **VGG** = neat stack of Lego blocks (3x3 convs).
        
    - **ResNet** = highway with shortcut ramps (skip connections).
        
- **Difference**: shows the evolution → deeper networks, but tricks (skip connections) prevent problems.
    

---

## **Lecture 12 – Transfer Learning**

- **Concept**: Reuse pre-trained networks for new tasks.
    
- **Methods**:
    
    - **Feature extractor**: freeze conv layers, only train classifier.
        
    - **Fine-tuning**: adjust some layers to adapt.
        
- **Visual**:
    
    - Imagine borrowing a chef:
        
        - Feature extractor = keep their knife skills, only change plating.
            
        - Fine-tuning = retrain them for your cuisine but keep core skills.
            
- **Difference**: Instead of training from scratch → save time/data by reusing old “visual knowledge.”

### 🔑 **Side-by-Side Visual Contrasts**

**CNN vs FC Nets**

```
FC: [All pixels connected to all neurons] → millions of wires ⚡
CNN: [Small filter slides over] → few wires, shared weights
```

**Pooling**

```
Original: 🟦🟥🟩🟨
Pooled:   🟦 🟩
          🟥 🟨
 (compressed version)
```

**Dropout**

```
Layer: [🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢]
Dropout: [🟢 ❌ 🟢 ❌ 🟢]
(keeps network from over-relying)
```

**ResNet Skip Connection**

```
Normal deep net: Input → Layer1 → Layer2 → ... → Output
ResNet:          Input ↘──────────────↗ Output
 (shortcut highway avoids vanishing gradients)
```

**Transfer Learning**

```
Pretrained CNN (knows cats, dogs, cars)
   ↓
New Task (classify X-rays)
   → keep lower filters (edges, shapes)
   → retrain top layers (medical features)
```

---

## **Lecture 15 – Segmentation I**

    - Instance segmentation = label _which cat_ is which.
        
- **Visual**:
    
    - Bounding box = drawing a square around a cat.
        
    - Semantic segmentation = coloring all cat pixels red.

    - U-Net = like an hourglass with **skip bridges** that carry details from encoder → decoder.
        
- **Difference vs Lec 15**: Lec 15 = _task_. Lec 16 = _tools/architectures_.
    

---

## **Lecture 17 – Representation Learning I**

    - Contrastive = bring similar images closer (dog vs another dog) and push dissimilar apart (dog vs car).
        
- **Difference**: Instead of supervised labels, network teaches itself structure in data.
    

---

## **Lecture 18 – Representation Learning II**

- **Concepts**:
    
    - More advanced SSL techniques (SimCLR, BYOL, MoCo).
        
    - Pretraining on massive datasets → finetune downstream.
        
- **Visual**:
    
    - Imagine a language exchange: model learns “visual grammar” by comparing billions of photos. Later, you teach it your smaller specific language (task).
        
- **Difference vs Lec 17**: Lec 17 = basic self-supervised ideas. Lec 18 = modern implementations at scale.
