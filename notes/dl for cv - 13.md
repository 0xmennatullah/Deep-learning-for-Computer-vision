# Lecture 13: Attention — Detailed Skeleton

---

### 1. Motivation: Why Attention?

- **Bottleneck in Seq2Seq Models** (~encoder–decoder RNNs)  
    Traditional approaches compress an entire input (like a sentence or image) into a single fixed-length vector. This often struggles with long or detailed inputs—it’s like trying to summarize a whole chapter with just one sentence.
    
- **Attention's Superpower**  
    Instead of memorizing everything in a summary notebook, attention says: _"Why not just look back at the parts you need when predicting each output?"_  
    It provides a “soft lookup,” selecting relevant parts of the input dynamically.
    

---

### 2. Soft Attention Mechanism (e.g., for Captioning)

Based on **“Show, Attend and Tell”**:

1. **Extract spatial features** from an image via a CNN, producing a grid of features (size L×DL \times D).
    
2. At each decoding step tt:
    
    - Compute **alignment scores** et,ie_{t,i} comparing decoder state hth_t to each image feature aia_i.
        
    - Apply **softmax** to get attention weights αt,i\alpha_{t,i}, forming a distribution over image regions.
        
    - Compute the **context vector** zt=∑αt,iaiz_t = \sum \alpha_{t,i} a_i, a weighted blend of spatial features.  
        ([CS231n](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2016/winter1516_lecture13.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lecture 13:"))
        
3. Feed this context into the decoder to predict the next word, enabling dynamic focus (e.g., attending to the dog's face when generating "dog", then shifting to its tail when generating "tail").  
    ([CS231n](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2016/winter1516_lecture13.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lecture 13:"))
    

**Soft vs. Hard Attention:**

- **Soft attention** (above) is fully differentiable—trainable via standard backpropagation.
    
- **Hard attention** picks a single location (`argmax`). Since it's non-differentiable, it requires reinforcement learning to train.

### 3. Sequence-to-Sequence Attention (Bahdanau’s Approach)

1. Encode the input sequence (e.g., words) into a series of hidden states {h1,…,hT}\{h_1, \dots, h_T\}.
    
2. For each decoder step:
    
    - Calculate alignment scores et,i=score(st−1,hi)e_{t,i} = \text{score}(s_{t-1}, h_i).
        
    - Derive attention weights αt,i\alpha_{t,i} via softmax normalization.
        
    - Compute the context vector ct=∑αt,ihic_t = \sum \alpha_{t,i} h_i.
        
    - Update decoder state using `(previous output, previous state, c_t)` to generate the next token.  
        ([CS231n](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2024/lecture_8.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lecture 8: Attention and Transformers"), [Medium](https://medium.com/%40ilyarudyak/cs231n-vs-eecs-498-85536ae615?utm_source=chatgpt.com "cs231n vs. EECS 498"))
        

This strategy allows models to dynamically recall which input positions matter most at each output step—improving translation, captioning, and more.

### 4. Applications Across Domains

- **Machine Translation**  
    Enables alignment between source and target languages. Visualization shows diagonal patterns when word orders align.  
    ([CS231n](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2024/lecture_8.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lecture 8: Attention and Transformers"))
    
- **Speech Recognition**  
    Attention helps mapping variable-length audio signals to text.
    
- **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**  
    Attention lets a system focus on relevant image regions based on the question (e.g., “What color is the cat?” → attend to the cat).
    
- **Video Captioning**  
    Sequentially attends across video frames to describe dynamic scenes.
    

These examples feature dynamic, context-sensitive focus—a core strength of attention.

### 5. Benefits of Using Attention

- **Performance Boost**: Helps with sequences or inputs too long to fit into one vector.
    
- **Interpretability**: Attention maps (heatmaps) reveal what the model focuses on—great for debugging.
    
- **Efficiency**: In transformer models, self-attention allows parallel processing across all input positions, replacing slower recurrence.  
    ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_%28deep_learning_architecture%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Transformer (deep learning architecture)"), [CS231n](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/2021/slides/2021/lecture_11.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lecture 11: Attention and Transformers"))

### Big Concept Integration & Future Directions

- **Attention** essentially provides flexible, content-based lookup over input.
    
- It addresses core limitations of RNNs (memory bottleneck, vanishing gradient over long sequences).
    
- Sets the stage for entirely attention-based models—like **Transformers**—which rely solely on stackable attention layers, often outperforming RNNs in both CV and NLP.

### How It Might Sound in Lecture

Imagine Justin Johnson saying something like:

> _"Instead of cramming the whole input into one vector, attention lets us dial in exactly what we want at each step—we don’t need to remember everything at all times. It’s like having a mind that says ‘Oh, I need to look at that part over there.’ And it’s fully differentiable—just tune the weights via backprop, no reinforcement learning tricks needed (unless you're using hard attention)."_
---
# mini-glossary (what each letter means)

**Input side (encoder)**

- **xix_i**: the _i-th input token embedding_. If the input sentence is “le chat noir”, then x1=emb("le")x_1=\text{emb}("le"), x2=emb("chat")x_2=\text{emb}("chat"), x3=emb("noir")x_3=\text{emb}("noir").
    
- **hih_i**: the _encoder hidden state_ after reading token ii. It summarizes the input **up to** position ii (and, with BiRNNs, also the right context).  
    Recurrence: hi=fenc(hi−1,xi)h_i = f_{\text{enc}}(h_{i-1}, x_i) (RNN/GRU/LSTM cell).
    

**Output side (decoder)**

- **⟨BOS⟩\langle\text{BOS}\rangle**: special “begin” token. We feed it to start decoding.
    
- **yt−1y_{t-1}**: the previous output token (during training, usually the ground-truth token via teacher forcing).
    
- **sts_t**: the _decoder hidden state_ at output time step tt. It is the decoder’s _internal memory of what it has generated so far and what it “expects” next_.  
    Recurrence (one common form): st=fdec(st−1,emb(yt−1),ct−1)s_t = f_{\text{dec}}(s_{t-1}, \text{emb}(y_{t-1}), c_{t-1}) (some variants omit ct−1c_{t-1} here).
    
- **“current state”** = sts_t. It’s _not_ “the part I want to translate”; it’s the decoder’s _thought bubble_ right now (what’s been said, grammar needs, etc.). It _asks_ attention to fetch relevant source info.
    

**Attention bits**

- **Query qtq_t**: the thing that _asks the question_. Here, qt=stq_t = s_t (decoder state).
    
- **Keys KK** and **Values VV**: the _memory you can look up_. In classic seq2seq attention, both are the encoder states: K=V=[h1,…,hn]K=V=[h_1,\dots,h_n].
    
- **Score et,ie_{t,i}**: how compatible is _query sts_t_ with _key hih_i_?  
    Examples:  
    • Dot: et,i=st⊤hie_{t,i} = s_t^\top h_i  
    • Additive (Bahdanau): et,i=v⊤tanh⁡(Wsst+Whhi)e_{t,i} = v^\top \tanh(W_s s_t + W_h h_i)
    
- **Attention weights αt,i\alpha_{t,i}**: softmax over scores:  
    αt,i=exp⁡(et,i)∑jexp⁡(et,j)\alpha_{t,i}=\frac{\exp(e_{t,i})}{\sum_j \exp(e_{t,j})}. A probability distribution over input positions.
    
- **Context ctc_t**: the _answer you retrieve_ = weighted blend of values:  
    ct=∑iαt,i hic_t=\sum_i \alpha_{t,i} \, h_i.
    

**Predicting a word**

- **Logits**: combine decoder state and context (one common form):  
    ot=Wo [st;ct]+boo_t = W_o\,[s_t; c_t] + b_o (concatenate then linear).
    
- **Output distribution**: p(yt ∣ ⋅)=softmax(ot)p(y_t\,|\,\cdot)=\text{softmax}(o_t). Pick the next word.
    

## connect to the flashlight analogy

- The **bookshelf** of facts you can shine on = the encoder states [h1,h2,h3][h_1,h_2,h_3].
    
- The **flashlight angle/aim** = attention weights αt,∗\alpha_{t,*}.
    
- The **focus question** (“what do I need right now?”) = decoder state sts_t (the _query_).
    
- The **lighted summary** you bring back = context vector ctc_t (weighted mix of hih_i).
    
- Then you **speak a word** using both your _internal plan_ sts_t and the _looked-up info_ ctc_t.
    

## worked example: “le chat noir” → “the black cat”

We’ll do t=1,2,3t=1,2,3 (three English words), and at each step list all variables.

**Encoder (once at the start)**

- Inputs: x1=emb("le")x_1=\text{emb}("le"), x2=emb("chat")x_2=\text{emb}("chat"), x3=emb("noir")x_3=\text{emb}("noir").
    
- Run RNN/GRU/LSTM:  
    h1=fenc(h0,x1)h_1=f_{\text{enc}}(h_0,x_1)  
    h2=fenc(h1,x2)h_2=f_{\text{enc}}(h_1,x_2)  
    h3=fenc(h2,x3)h_3=f_{\text{enc}}(h_2,x_3)
    
- Memory bank (keys/values): [h1,h2,h3][h_1,h_2,h_3].
    

---

## Step t = 1 (predict **“the”**)

**What we have**

- Previous token: y0=⟨BOS⟩y_0=\langle\text{BOS}\rangle.
    
- Previous decoder state: s0s_0 (initialized, e.g., zeros or from encoder final state).
    
- (Optional) previous context c0c_0 (often zeros).
    

**Update decoder state**

- s1=fdec(s0,emb(⟨BOS⟩),c0)s_1 = f_{\text{dec}}(s_0, \text{emb}(\langle\text{BOS}\rangle), c_0).  
    Intuition: “I’m about to start a sentence; likely need a determiner.”
    

**Compute attention scores**

- Query = s1s_1, keys = [h1,h2,h3][h_1,h_2,h_3].  
    Example scores (made-up numbers to illustrate):
    
    - e1,1=score(s1,h1)=2.1e_{1,1} = \text{score}(s_1,h_1)= 2.1 (good match to “le”)
        
    - e1,2=score(s1,h2)=0.3e_{1,2} = \text{score}(s_1,h_2)= 0.3
        
    - e1,3=score(s1,h3)=0.2e_{1,3} = \text{score}(s_1,h_3)= 0.2
        

**Softmax → attention weights**

- α1,∗=softmax([2.1, 0.3, 0.2])=[0.70, 0.16, 0.14]\alpha_{1,*} = \text{softmax}([2.1,\,0.3,\,0.2]) = [0.70,\,0.16,\,0.14] (approx.)
    

**Context**

- c1=0.70 h1+0.16 h2+0.14 h3c_1 = 0.70\,h_1 + 0.16\,h_2 + 0.14\,h_3.
    

**Predict next word**

- o1=Wo [s1;c1]+boo_1 = W_o\,[s_1;c_1]+b_o, p(y1)=softmax(o1)p(y_1)=\text{softmax}(o_1) → choose **“the”**.
    

_(Analogy: your current plan s1s_1 says “I probably need a determiner”; you shine the flashlight mostly on **“le”**; the blended info c1c_1 + your plan s1s_1 yields “the”.)_

---

## Step t = 2 (predict **“black”**)

**What we have**

- Previous token: y1=y_1="the" (during training, teacher forcing uses the gold token).
    
- Previous state: s1s_1, previous context: c1c_1.
    

**Update decoder state**

- s2=fdec(s1,emb("the"),c1)s_2 = f_{\text{dec}}(s_1, \text{emb}("the"), c_1).  
    Intuition: “I’ve said the article; now likely an adjective/noun. French order ‘chat noir’ often maps to ‘black cat’, so adjective first.”
    

**Attention scores**

- Query = s2s_2, keys = [h1,h2,h3][h_1,h_2,h_3].
    
    - e2,1=0.1e_{2,1}=0.1
        
    - e2,2=2.0e_{2,2}=2.0 (leans toward “chat” as head noun context)
        
    - e2,3=2.4e_{2,3}=2.4 (leans toward “noir” to get the adjective)
        

**Softmax → weights**

- α2,∗≈[0.05, 0.39, 0.56]\alpha_{2,*}\approx [0.05,\,0.39,\,0.56].
    

**Context**

- c2=0.05 h1+0.39 h2+0.56 h3c_2 = 0.05\,h_1 + 0.39\,h_2 + 0.56\,h_3.
    

**Predict**

- p(y2)=softmax(Wo[s2;c2]+bo)p(y_2)=\text{softmax}(W_o[s_2;c_2]+b_o) → **“black”**.
    

_(Analogy: your plan s2s_2 is “modify the noun with an adjective”; flashlight now concentrates on **“noir”** (and a bit of **“chat”**); you say “black”.)_

---

## Step t = 3 (predict **“cat”**)

**What we have**

- Previous token y2=y_2="black", state s2s_2, context c2c_2.
    

**Update decoder state**

- s3=fdec(s2,emb("black"),c2)s_3 = f_{\text{dec}}(s_2, \text{emb}("black"), c_2).  
    Intuition: “finish the noun phrase.”
    

**Attention scores**

- Query = s3s_3, keys = [h1,h2,h3][h_1,h_2,h_3].
    
    - e3,1=0.1e_{3,1}=0.1
        
    - e3,2=2.6e_{3,2}=2.6 (focus on “chat”)
        
    - e3,3=0.8e_{3,3}=0.8
        

**Softmax → weights**

- α3,∗≈[0.06, 0.79, 0.15]\alpha_{3,*}\approx [0.06,\,0.79,\,0.15].
    

**Context**

- c3=0.06 h1+0.79 h2+0.15 h3c_3 = 0.06\,h_1 + 0.79\,h_2 + 0.15\,h_3.
    

**Predict**

- p(y3)=softmax(Wo[s3;c3]+bo)p(y_3)=\text{softmax}(W_o[s_3;c_3]+b_o) → **“cat”**.
    

_(Analogy: your plan s3s_3: “say the noun”; flashlight centers on **“chat”**; output “cat”.)_

---

## what sts_t _is_ and _isn’t_

- **Is**: a vector “thought bubble” inside the decoder summarizing:  
    (1) what you’ve already emitted (history),  
    (2) grammatical/semantic expectations for the next word,  
    (3) optionally the previous context ct−1c_{t-1}.  
    It becomes the **query** that asks attention: “show me the relevant source bits for what I need now.”
    
- **Isn’t**: it is _not_ the “part of the source you want to translate.” That role is the **context** ctc_t, which you _compute_ by attending to encoder states using sts_t.
    

---

## quick recap cheat-sheet

- Encode: hi=fenc(hi−1,xi)h_i=f_{\text{enc}}(h_{i-1},x_i).
    
- Decode state: st=fdec(st−1,emb(yt−1),ct−1)s_t=f_{\text{dec}}(s_{t-1},\text{emb}(y_{t-1}), c_{t-1}).
    
- Scores: et,i=score(st,hi)e_{t,i}=\text{score}(s_t,h_i).
    
- Weights: αt,i=softmaxi(et,i)\alpha_{t,i}=\text{softmax}_i(e_{t,i}).
    
- Context: ct=∑iαt,ihic_t=\sum_i \alpha_{t,i}h_i.
    
- Predict: p(yt)=softmax(Wo[st;ct]+bo)p(y_t)=\text{softmax}(W_o[s_t;c_t]+b_o).
    





# notes
- St ain't actually a thinking process, it's more of a math equation too but a bit complicated, it 9includes the y i said/output in the last time, context of the current index, state of the last time.

---

## 🔹 Part 1: Encoder–Decoder Attention (Seq2Seq with attention)

### 1. Encoder hidden states hh

- You asked: _what do you mean by hidden states are “context”_?  
    👉 Each encoder hidden state hjh_j is not just a representation of word xjx_j.  
    In an RNN/LSTM encoder:
    
    - When processing word x1x_1, you compute h1=f(x1)h_1 = f(x_1).
        
    - When processing word x2x_2, you compute h2=f(x2,h1)h_2 = f(x_2, h_1).  
        So h2h_2 contains info about x2x_2 **and** h1h_1 (which contains info about x1x_1).
        
    - By the time you reach hjh_j, it encodes word xjx_j **plus all the previous words**.  
        So, “context” means each hjh_j isn’t isolated—it knows about earlier words.
        

That’s why encoder states hh are sometimes called **contextual embeddings**.

---

### 2. Decoder hidden state sts_t

- At decoding step tt, we have st−1s_{t-1}, the state from the previous output word.
    
- We compute an **alignment score** for every source word:
    
    et,j=score(st−1,hj)e_{t,j} = \text{score}(s_{t-1}, h_j)
    
    This answers: _“how relevant is source word jj to what I want to say at step tt?”_.
    

Yes—you’re right—we do this for **every word** in the source sentence.

---

### 3. Attention weights α\alpha

- Normalize all scores with softmax:
    
    αt,j=exp⁡(et,j)∑kexp⁡(et,k)\alpha_{t,j} = \frac{\exp(e_{t,j})}{\sum_k \exp(e_{t,k})}
- So each source word gets a probability weight saying how important it is for producing the next target word.
    

---

### 4. Context vector

- Then we compute:
    
    ct=∑jαt,j⋅hjc_t = \sum_j \alpha_{t,j} \cdot h_j
- So instead of stuffing the **whole sentence** into one vector (like the old seq2seq bottleneck), we build a **dynamic vector** each step.
    
    - If we’re translating “the dog runs” into French, when generating “chien”, the attention will focus on “dog”.
        
    - When generating “court”, attention will shift to “runs”.
        

---

✅ So your intuition was right:

- hjh_j = encoder state (source words with context)
    
- sts_t = decoder state (what I want to say next)
    
- Attention = compare them at each step to decide focus.
    

---

## 🔹 Part 2: Self-Attention (Transformer encoder/decoder)

Now—self-attention is different. Instead of comparing decoder thoughts sts_t with encoder states hh, we compare **words within the same sentence**.

---

### 1. Input matrix XX

- Suppose input sentence = [“The”, “dog”, “runs”].
    
- Each word is embedded into a vector → stack them into a matrix:
    
    X=[x1x2x3]X = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix}
    
    (Each row = a word embedding).
    

---

### 2. Creating Q, K, V

- For each word vector xix_i, we project it into 3 different roles:
    
    Qi=xiWQ,Ki=xiWK,Vi=xiWVQ_i = x_i W^Q, \quad K_i = x_i W^K, \quad V_i = x_i W^V
- WQ,WK,WVW^Q, W^K, W^V are trainable matrices (learned during training, like any NN weight).
    
- Why? Because we want each word to be able to:
    
    - **Ask a question** (Q: “what context do I need?”)
        
    - **Give an address** (K: “here’s my meaning, if you’re looking for it”)
        
    - **Provide content** (V: “this is my value, use me if I’m relevant”).
        

So it’s not “one static weight per word.” Instead, the same **global matrices** WQ,WK,WVW^Q, W^K, W^V are applied to all words → learned ways of mapping words into these roles.

---

### 3. Attention scores

- For each pair of words (i, j):
    
    score(i,j)=Qi⋅KjT\text{score}(i,j) = Q_i \cdot K_j^T
    
    = _how much word i should pay attention to word j_.
    
- Example: for word “runs”, it might attend strongly to “dog” (subject) and less to “The”.
    

---

### 4. Scaling

- Then divide by dk\sqrt{d_k}:
    
    QiKjTdk\frac{Q_i K_j^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}
    
    where dkd_k = dimension of the key vector.
    
- Why divide? Because when dimensions are large, dot products grow huge → softmax becomes very peaky (almost one-hot). Scaling keeps scores stable.
    

---

### 5. Softmax → weights

- For each word ii, softmax over all jj:
    
    αi,j=softmax(QiKjTdk)\alpha_{i,j} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_i K_j^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)
- Now αi,j\alpha_{i,j} tells how much word ii should look at word jj.
    

---

### 6. Weighted sum of values

- Finally, each word representation is updated:
    
    zi=∑jαi,jVjz_i = \sum_j \alpha_{i,j} V_j
- So the new embedding of word ii is a **mixture** of other words’ values.
    
    - “dog” may attend to “runs” → its representation encodes that it’s the subject of an action.
        
    - “runs” may attend to “dog” → its representation encodes who is doing the action.
        

---

## 🔹 The Insight

- In seq2seq attention: we ask “how relevant is source word hjh_j to my current decoding state st−1s_{t-1}?”
    
- In self-attention: each word **looks at other words** in the same sentence to gather context.
    
- That’s why transformers don’t need recurrence—they build context by letting every word attend to every other.
    

---

👉 Summary:

- Encoder attention: hh (source context) vs. ss (decoder thought).
    
- Self-attention: Q,K,VQ, K, V all come from the same XX.
    
- WQ,WK,WVW^Q, W^K, W^V are trainable and not “static per word”—they let the network learn **how words should query and respond**.
    
- Scaling /dk/\sqrt{d_k} = stabilization trick.
    
- The weighted sum makes each word representation richer, combining info from all other words.
    

---

### 🔹 1. The analogy Q ↔ S and K ↔ H

- You’re **absolutely right**:
    
    - **Q (Query)** is like the decoder’s hidden state **S** → it represents _what I’m currently trying to figure out / focus on_.
        
    - **K (Key)** is like the encoder’s hidden state **H** → it represents _the information available in the input words_.
        
- So when we compute `Q·Kᵀ`, it’s like asking: _“Given my current query (thought), how relevant is each input word (memory/key)?”_
    

---

### 🔹 2. What is V (Value)?

- Think of **V (Value)** as the _content you’ll actually use if this word is deemed relevant_.
    
- Analogy:
    
    - K is like a **book index entry** (tells us _where to look_).
        
    - Q is like a **search query** (tells us _what we’re looking for_).
        
    - V is like the **page content itself** (the actual text you’ll read once you find it).
        

So yes — **V is “the actual word information”**, not the alignment, not the question — the _payload_ that will be mixed together depending on how relevant it is.

---

### 🔹 3. Do we calculate separately for each word?

- Yes! For **each input word** (each row in X), we generate its own Q, K, V:
    
    ```
    Q = X W_Q
    K = X W_K
    V = X W_V
    ```
    
    where `X` is the whole input sentence matrix (rows = words, columns = embedding dimensions).
    
- Then, for **each word’s query Qᵢ**:
    
    1. Compare it with **all other words’ keys Kⱼ** to get relevance scores (alignment).
        
    2. Turn scores into probabilities (attention weights αᵢⱼ).
        
    3. Compute the new representation of word i as a weighted sum of all Vⱼ:
        
        ```
        zᵢ = Σⱼ αᵢⱼ Vⱼ
        ```
        
- 🔑 So yes: each word gets **its own new representation** (row in the new output matrix Z).  
    That means the final matrix Z has the same number of rows (words) as X, but each row is now a _contextualized version_ of that word.
    

---

### 🔹 4. Is this “once and static”?

- No, it’s **not static** after one calculation.
    
    - Each **layer** of self-attention produces a _new contextualized matrix Z_.
        
    - That Z then becomes the input X for the **next layer**.
        
- So words keep **updating their representations layer by layer**, gradually mixing more information from the whole sentence.
    

---

### 🔹 5. The big intuition

- Without attention, each word is just its embedding = isolated meaning.
    
- With attention, each word’s new vector says:
    
    > “I’m word X, but now I carry weighted traces of other words in my sentence, according to how relevant they are to me right now.”
    

So yes: each word **becomes a blend of other words’ information**. That’s why self-attention is so powerful — it lets “dog” understand that “barks” is close, or “bank” should mean financial because “money” is nearby, etc.

---

✅ Summary of your analogy:

- **Q ≈ S** (query = what I want)
    
- **K ≈ H** (key = what exists)
    
- **V = actual word embedding (content)**
    
- Each word i produces its new contextualized meaning by blending the V’s of all words, weighted by how relevant they are to its Q.
    

---

### 🔹 1. Does each word see all the words?

Yes ✅.

- When we calculate the new representation for word **i**, its query `Qᵢ` is compared with **all keys `Kⱼ` from every word j** (including itself).
    
- Then it forms a weighted sum over **all values Vⱼ**.
    
- So each new word embedding **depends on all words in the sentence**.
    

---

### 🔹 2. Do they use the new or old representations?

They **only use the old X** (the input to the layer).

- First, from the old X we compute Q, K, V for **all words at once**:
    
    ```
    Q = X W_Q
    K = X W_K
    V = X W_V
    ```
    
- Then, for each word’s row `Qᵢ`, we compute attention scores against **all Kⱼ**.
    
- Finally, we use those scores to mix **the old Vⱼ’s** (not new ones).
    

👉 So every word’s new representation is **based only on the old X, not partially-updated rows**.  
There’s no “in-place overwrite.” All rows in the new matrix are computed in parallel from the same old matrix.

---

### 🔹 3. So how does the new X get built?

- Imagine you have an old X (say, 5 words).
    
- You compute Q, K, V matrices from it.
    
- Then for **word 1**, you compute new z₁ (contextualized).
    
- For **word 2**, compute new z₂ (contextualized).
    
- … etc.
    

At the end, you **stack** them:

```
Z = [z₁
     z₂
     z₃
     ...
     zₙ]
```

So Z has the same number of rows (words) as X, but each row is now enriched with context.  
Then Z becomes the new “X” for the next layer.

---

### 🔹 4. Intuition

- Each word **acts independently** when asking its “question” (query).
    
- But when answering, it **pulls information from the same pool** of values V (which came from the old X).
    
- That’s why **order doesn’t matter inside a single self-attention layer** — all words’ new representations are computed in parallel, all based on the old X.
    

---

### 🔹 5. Visual analogy

Think of it like a classroom:

- Old X = all students’ raw notes.
    
- Each student (word i) asks a different question Qᵢ.
    
- The teacher compares the question with all students’ notes (Kⱼ) to decide whose notes are relevant.
    
- Then the student makes a new, enriched notebook zᵢ = weighted mixture of all notes Vⱼ.
    
- Crucially: they don’t pass their new notes around during this step. Everyone uses the **old notes** as references, then writes their own updated notes simultaneously.
    

---

✅ So your understanding is **very close**:

- Yes, each word “sees” all others.
    
- Yes, the new row is appended to a new matrix Z.
    
- No, the next word does **not** use the already-updated rows — all rows are computed in parallel from the old X.

---

### 🔹 1. “One chunk” = **Transformer block**

When people say “self-attention is all in one place,” they usually mean:

- In a transformer, there isn’t a separate RNN-style encoder and decoder hidden state flowing step by step.
    
- Instead, you take your whole input sentence (matrix X), and push it through **layers** of processing.
    

Each **layer** = a **Transformer block**, and it’s made of:

1. **Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)**
    
2. **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**  
    (+ layer norm, residuals, dropout, etc.)
    

So when I said “Z becomes the new X for the next layer,” I meant:

- Input: X → Self-Attention → Z
    
- Then Z goes into the feed-forward network → new Z′
    
- Then that output Z′ is passed as **the input X** into the _next_ transformer block.
    
- This stacking repeats for N layers (e.g. 6, 12, 24 … depending on the model size).
    

---

### 🔹 2. Encoder-only vs Decoder-only vs Full Transformer

- **Encoder-only models** (e.g. BERT): stack many self-attention layers on top of each other.
    
- **Decoder-only models** (e.g. GPT): also stack self-attention layers, but with masking so words can’t see the future.
    
- **Encoder-decoder models** (e.g. the original Transformer for translation): first stack self-attention layers in the encoder, then feed the encoder output into the decoder (which also has self-attention + cross-attention).
    

So when you’re looking at _just self-attention_, it feels like “one chunk” — but in reality it’s a **building block**, and transformers use many of those blocks stacked.

---

### 🔹 3. Why multiple layers?

- One self-attention layer lets each word look at all other words once.
    
- But stacking layers lets words **refine their understanding** iteratively:
    
    - Layer 1: “dog” learns it modifies “runs.”
        
    - Layer 2: “runs” connects to “quickly.”
        
    - Layer 3: The subject-verb-adverb structure is fully contextualized.
        

So each new layer gives richer and richer contextual embeddings.

---

✅ So:

- Self-attention is not the whole model, it’s the **core component**.
    
- Each “next layer” is just another transformer block stacked above.
    
- That’s why Z (output of one self-attention layer) becomes the new X (input) for the next one.
